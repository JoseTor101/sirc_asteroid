# Asteroids 2600 Game Recreation

This project is part of the Nand to Tetris course, where we decided to recreate the classic Atari 2600 game Asteroids (1981 Atari). Using Jack language, we implemented all the concepts learned throughout the course, including memory management and screen control. Additionally, we went a step further and created a 2.5D environment where we added a z-axis to control the distance from the player's camera.
